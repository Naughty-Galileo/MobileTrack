# MobileTrack

## Data Preparation
Put the tracking datasets in ./data. It should look like:
   ```
   ${STARK_ROOT}
    -- data
        -- lasot
            |-- airplane
            |-- basketball
            |-- bear
            ...
        -- got10k
            |-- test
            |-- train
            |-- val
        -- coco
            |-- annotations
            |-- images
        -- trackingnet
            |-- TRAIN_0
            |-- TRAIN_1
            ...
            |-- TRAIN_11
            |-- TEST
   ```
## Set project paths
Run the following command to set paths for this project
```
python tracking/create_default_local_file.py --workspace_dir . --data_dir ./data --save_dir .
```
After running this command, you can also modify paths by editing these two files
```
lib/train/admin/local.py  # paths about training
lib/test/evaluation/local.py  # paths about testing
```
